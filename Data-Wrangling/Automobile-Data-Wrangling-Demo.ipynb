Now, let's apply this concept to the world of data.\n","\n","In the data world, \"wrangling\" is the process of dealing with difficult or messy data. This typically involves cleaning up raw, erroneous, or incomplete data, which can often consume 90% of a data scientist's or data analyst's time. The goal is to transform that messy data into a nice, structured, and easy-to-use format. This is the essence of data wrangling.\n","\n","At this point, you might assume that data wrangling is simply another term for data cleaning, data remediation, or data munging. While there is overlap, data wrangling encompasses a broader set of processes.\n","\n","These processes are designed to transform raw data into a format that is more readily usable for analysis. The specific steps involved can differ from project to project, depending on the nature of the data and the goals we are trying to achieve.\n","\n","\n","Some of the example include:\n","\n","* Merging mulitple data sources into a single dataset for analysis\n","* Identifying gaps in data and either filling or deleting them\n","* Unncessary data removal which are irrelevant to the project\n","* Understanding of outliers(analysing the importance of outliers)\n","\n","Note: Though data cleaning and data wrangling used interchangeably, there is distinction.\n","\n","* Data wrangling is the overal process of transformation raw data into a more usable form.\n","\n","* Data cleaning is a critical step in the data wrangling process to remove inaccurate and inconsistent data.\n","\n","[Source](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jSMmihO97gtG"},"source":["# Example: Used Cars Pricing\n","\n","For this process I
