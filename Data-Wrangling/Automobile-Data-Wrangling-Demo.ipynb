Now, let's apply this concept to the world of data.\n","\n","In the data world, \"wrangling\" is the process of dealing with difficult or messy data. This typically involves cleaning up raw, erroneous, or incomplete data, which can often consume 90% of a data scientist's or data analyst's time. The goal is to transform that messy data into a nice, structured, and easy-to-use format. This is the essence of data wrangling.\n","\n","At this point, you might assume that data wrangling is simply another term for data cleaning, data remediation, or data munging. While there is overlap, data wrangling encompasses a broader set of processes.\n","\n","These processes are designed to transform raw data into a format that is more readily usable for analysis. The specific steps involved can differ from project to project, depending on the nature of the data and the goals we are trying to achieve.\n","\n","\n","Some of the example include:\n","\n","* Merging mulitple data sources into a single dataset for analysis\n","* Identifying gaps in data and either filling or deleting them\n","* Unncessary data removal which are irrelevant to the project\n","* Understanding of outliers(analysing the importance of outliers)\n","\n","Note: Though data cleaning and data wrangling used interchangeably, there is distinction.\n","\n","* Data wrangling is the overal process of transformation raw data into a more usable form.\n","\n","* Data cleaning is a critical step in the data wrangling process to remove inaccurate and inconsistent data.\n","\n","[Source](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jSMmihO97gtG"},"source":["# Example: Used Cars Pricing\n","\n","For this process I

Often data has different unit or scales. \n","\n","For example:\n","a. Suppose in the dataset, there is one column \"price\" which is measured in \"dollars\" and another in \"meters\", the features with larger values might disproprotionately affect the model unless both are standardised. \n","\n","Data standardization is a preprocessing step, where the features(data) are transfomred to have __zero mean__ and __unit variance(1)__, which ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's training process. \n","\n","Why? \n","\n","various reasons: \n","\n","a. When features are on different scales, machine learning algorithms may place more importance on features with larger scales. Standardization ensures that each feature contributes equally\n","\n","b. Improves Model Performance: Many algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) perform better when features are standardized.\n","\n","c. Gradient-based methods: Models like linear regression, neural networks, and gradient descent also benefit from standardized data since it ensures faster and more stable convergence."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1143,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Height(cm)</th>\n","      <th>Weight(kg)</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Suresh</td>\n","      <td>170</td>\n","      <td>65</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Mahesh</td>\n","      <td>160</td>\n","      <td>70</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Ramesh</td>\n","      <td>180</td>\n","      <td>80</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Sailesh</td>\n","      <td>150</td>\n","      <td>55</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["      Name  Height(cm)  Weight(kg)\n","0   Suresh         170          65\n","1   Mahesh         160          70\n","2   Ramesh         180          80\n","3  Sailesh         150          55"]},"execution_count":1143,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","example = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'Name' : ['Suresh', 'Mahesh', 'Ramesh', 'Sailesh'],\n","    'Height(cm)' : [170, 160, 180, 150],\n","    'Weight(kg)' : [65, 70, 80, 55]\n","\n","})\n","example"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The features are on diffeent scales(height in cm and weight in kg), and has large values discripancies. \n","\n","The formula for standardization is: \n","\n","$$ z = (x -
