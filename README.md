# Model Development
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that focus on developing predictive models using both linear and multiple linear regression techniques. The notebooks provide insights into building and evaluating regression models for real-world datasets.

Notebooks in the Model Development Folder:

[**Linear and Multiple LR.ipynb**](https://github.com/ghatanisuresh/DataScience_tutorial/blob/main/Model%20Development/Linear%20and%20Multiple%20LR.ipynb): This notebook covers both simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. It explores the following:
   * Simple Linear Regression: Demonstrates how to build a model with one predictor variable, examining how the target variable (dependent variable) changes with the predictor.
   * Multiple Linear Regression: Expands the model to include multiple predictor variables. It shows how to evaluate the model using metrics such as R², adjusted R², and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
