# Correlation Analysis

The file 'correlation analysis' is the simple exploration which analyzes the relationship between various car attributes such as mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis includes generating a correlation matrix and visualizing the results using a heatmap.

**Features:**

Load the Auto MPG dataset.

Clean the data by handling missing values in the horsepower column.

Calculate the correlation matrix for relevant attributes.

Visualize the correlations using a heatmap.

Rotate and align x-axis labels for improved readability.

**Example Output:**

Correlation matrix heatmap showing the relationships between different car attributes.

**Technologies Used:**

Python for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
