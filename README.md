# Automobile Data Wrangling Demo

This repository demonstrates various data wrangling techniques using a dataset related to automobiles. It includes cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data to derive insights. This project is designed to help individuals understand how to handle messy datasets effectively and prepare them for analysis.

## Project Files

- **Automobile-Data-Wrangling-Demo.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the main data wrangling process. It walks through the steps of handling missing values, correcting data types, and analyzing relationships between features.
- **Automobile-Data-Wrangling-Demo.html**: An HTML version of the Jupyter notebook, making it accessible for users who prefer to view the process in a browser without running the notebook.
- **clean_df.csv**: A cleaned version of the automobile dataset after wrangling, ready for analysis or further machine learning tasks.
- **LaptopPriceEDA.ipynb**: 

## Key Processes

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Correcting data types.
   - Normalizing and transforming values for consistency.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifying relationships between features.
   - Creating visualizations to summarize the data.

3. **Data Preparation for Modeling**:
   - Transforming categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

# Correlation Analysis

The file 'correlation analysis' is the simple exploration which analyzes the relationship between various car attributes such as mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis includes generating a correlation matrix and visualizing the results using a heatmap.

**Features:**

Load the Auto MPG dataset.

Clean the data by handling missing values in the horsepower column.

Calculate the correlation matrix for relevant attributes.

Visualize the correlations using a heatmap.

Rotate and align x-axis labels for improved readability.

**Example Output:**

Correlation matrix heatmap showing the relationships between different car attributes.

**Technologies Used:**

Python for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
